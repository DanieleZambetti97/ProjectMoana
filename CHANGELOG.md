## HEAD
- **First stable version 1.0.0**: **breaking changes**:
  - the old command ``demo.jl --options`` won't work anymore: now use ``render.jl --options``. For a more detailed list of options check the [README](https://github.com/DanieleZambetti97/ProjectMoana/blob/master/README.md);
  - the scenes must be written in a text file and then passed to `render.jl`;
  - changes in the options of `pfm2ldr.jl` (check the [README](https://github.com/DanieleZambetti97/ProjectMoana/blob/master/README.md)).

## 2021-06-08
- **Breaking change**: demo.jl is called from command line using options and not arguments (e.g.: ``demo.jl 720 600`` won't work anymore, use instead: ``demo.jl --width 720 --height 600``);
- Adding the Path Tracer algorithm to generate images with spheres and planes. 

## 2021-05-23
- Fixing an issue with the pixel-grid generated by Cameras. [#9](https://github.com/DanieleZambetti97/ProjectMoana/issues/9)

## 2021-05-20
- Fixing an issue with the location of the image generated. [#3](https://github.com/DanieleZambetti97/ProjectMoana/issues/8)

## 2021-05-19
- **Breaking change**: adding new executable ``demo.jl`` (generating the image of 10 spheres) and changing the old ``main.jl`` into ``pfm2ldr.jl`` (converting PFM images to any LDR format).

## 2021-05-05

- Fixing an issue with the vertical order of the pixels (the images were generate upside down.) [#3](https://github.com/DanieleZambetti97/ProjectMoana/issues/3)

## Version 0.1.0
